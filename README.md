# Data privacy is a human right yet most people do not have it
In this document, I discuss two articles about Data privacy in today's world and how although it should be a basic human right, most people do not have it. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
[Why Data Privacy Is A Human Right (And What Businesses Should Do About It)] https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2021/06/07/why-data-privacy-is-a-human-right-and-what-businesses-should-do-about-it/?sh=70bac224ec3c, This Forbes article talks about the increase in importance of data privacy as being a human right and the negative consequences for companies that do not follow it. The United Nations declared internet access a human right, and the writer, Philip argues that "if accessing the internet is a human right, then determining how we use the internet should be as well." Companies have previously been able to collect internet users' data without consent, but this is changing as consumers become more aware of their rights and demand greater control over their data. Data privacy legislation is still inconsistent globally, with some countries allowing consumers to opt in and others requiring them to opt out. Companies that don't comply with data privacy laws risk fines, negative publicity, and loss of customer trust. The article concludes by advising companies to conduct a data audit, familiarize themselves with relevant privacy laws, and always keep their customers' interests in mind.
